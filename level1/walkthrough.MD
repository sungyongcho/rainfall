level1@RainFall:~$ ls
level1
level1@RainFall:~$
```

let's run this and see what this does
```
level1@RainFall:~$ ./level1

```

okay, it seems it tries getting input, so let's try typing something

```
level1@RainFall:~$ ./level1
aaa
level1@RainFall:~$
```

It does nothing :/, so let's run gdb to see what's going on

```
level1@RainFall:~$ gdb level1
